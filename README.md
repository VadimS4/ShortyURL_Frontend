This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ShortyURL

### Ever get tired of sending super long URL's? Using a platform such as ShortyURL can help! Paste your long url and in return recieve a short and conveniently shareable link!

### Open [https://shortyurl-frontend.herokuapp.com/](https://shortyurl-frontend.herokuapp.com/) to view it in the browser.

#### This project was built using a Ruby on Rails backend and a Rails API. The Frontend was built using React. This project utilizes flex box and creates a responsive platform useable on all devices.

At the current moment, in order for the application to work, due to the nature of the API fetch requests, CORS needs to be disabled. I use a Google Chrome extension called Moesif CORS.
